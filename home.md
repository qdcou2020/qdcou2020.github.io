# About Me

My name is QD and I am a student at Code School.  I currently reside in Norman, Oklahoma.  I am an avid reader and researcher.  
I love to watch:  Judge Judy, the news, & The Big Bang Theory on television.
I am wanting to have a high level ability in coding so I can make future apps & websites.

# Goals

My goal is to receive a certification in coding.  by receiving a certification in coding, I will be able to become a freelancer 
so that i may work from home.  I also want to get a fun company job at a tech company so i can continue my learning from others 
& create "out-of-this-world" projects.  The reason why receiving a coding certification is important to me is due to that I want 
my financial independence and freedom to elevate.
